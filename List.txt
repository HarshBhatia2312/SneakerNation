21) Jordan System.23     Jordan_System_23.html
MRP : ₹ 9 695.00
Be the master of your modular style and redefine "cool" without saying goodbye to any of the cosy. The stretch-woven bootie hugs your foot with warmth and padding so you can rock it alone to get those indoor slipper vibes. Step into the lightweight, ventilated shell with its thick foam tread and feel what it means to be cushioned and stable. Put 'em together for a uniquely durable delight.
Lightweight Shell
The shell is composed of durable foam for a long (and comfortable) life. Indentations on the outsole give you the grip you need, while ventilation holes keep your soles feeling fresh. Jumpman and 23 Engineered logos are stamped right into the foam.
Stretchy and Secure
Think of the stretch-woven bootie as a structured, heavy-duty sock with a thin layer of rubber on the sole. Its pattern, woven into the material, is a subtle shout-out to the AJ3's iconic elephant print. Pull tabs make it extra easy to put on and take off.
Modular For the Win
Every System.23 element is interchangeable. Grab multiple pairs in different colours and go as hard as you want: 2 different bootie colours and 2 different shell colours? The rules are yours to break.
Extra Insole
If you want to wear just the shell, no bootie, we've included an extra insole that lets you do so comfortably—no slippage, no unwanted slide.
One Box Delivery
Created with sustainability in mind, the System.23 will be delivered in a single box with no unnecessary packaging. One box, and your shoes—that's it.
